Session Managment
    Handle websocket disconnects (end user's session?)
    Handle errors on socket connect

    when a connection comes in
         if there's a session cookie
            if there's a matching session
               reach into the session for the ship
               close out the ship's old socket
               assign the new socket to the ship
            else /* no matching session */
                treat as if there were no session cookie
         else
             create a new session

        Switch requires to return constructor directly.
        Call underscore 'underscore' everywhere (some places it's currently '_')

    Re-arrange project structure to have the client under the server directory
    Should have same ship after page reload.
    Explosions.
    Handle multiple bullets hitting a ship.
    Add cookies to server/spec/ship_command_spec.coffee
      Remove cookie guard to yasw server.
